# Getting Started

Keeping track of the multiple product variants added to the cart.

It should be possible to add a product to the cart from PLP. But it shouldn’t be possible to add a product to the cart without selected attributes. In order to solve this, you can either:

-   Add a product to the cart from PLP only if it doesn’t have any attributes (like AirTag).
-   Add a product to the cart with first selected attributes as defaults.
